# Competitive-Programming

My Solutions' codes for solved problems in different Online Judges.

The problems are solved in Kotlin, cpp, and java.

## Leetcode 
You can find Leetcode problems under the `leetcode` folder, you will find the files named by the number of the problem for example `5.kt` represents  [Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/) and so on.

For the Study plan problems' solutions, each plan is named with this plan for example you will find `Algo1` represents the first plan for Algorithms and will add more in the future Inshallah. 


For Other OJs you will find the files named by the name of the problem. 

For any inquiries please reach out to me. I am glad to help.
